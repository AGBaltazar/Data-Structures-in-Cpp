# Data-Structures-in-Cpp

### Week 1: Stacks
- Understanding stacks, a data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.
- Implementing stack operations such as push (adding an element) and pop (removing the top element).

### Week 2: Queues
- Understanding queues, a data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.
- Implementing queue operations such as enqueue (adding an element) and dequeue (removing the front element).

### Week 3: Sorting Algorithms
- Exploring various sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort.
- Understanding their time and space complexity, and their suitability for different input sizes.

### Week 4: Searching Algorithms
- Understanding searching algorithms like linear search, binary search, and hash-based searching.
- Exploring their time complexity and efficiency in finding elements in different data structures.

### Week 5: Binary Trees
- Understanding binary trees, a hierarchical data structure with each node having at most two children.
- Implementing binary tree traversal algorithms such as in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal.

### Week 6: Graphs
- Introduction to graphs, a collection of nodes (vertices) and their connections (edges).
- Implementation and traversal techniques of graphs, including depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS).
- Exploring graph representations, such as adjacency matrix and adjacency list.

# Stack

A stack is a fundamental data structure in computer science that follows the "last in, first out" (LIFO) principle. It can be visualized as a stack of items, similar to a stack of plates.

## Characteristics

- **LIFO Structure**: Elements are arranged in a linear order, and the last item added is the first one to be removed.
- **Push Operation**: Adding an element to the top of the stack is known as the "push" operation.
- **Pop Operation**: Removing the top element from the stack is known as the "pop" operation.
- **Peek Operation**: Viewing the top element without removing it is known as the "peek" or "top" operation.
- **Single Access Point**: Only the top element of the stack is accessible for insertion and deletion.
- **Sequential History**: Elements maintain their order, representing a history of actions or data.

## Stack of Plates Analogy

A practical way to understand a stack is by comparing it to a pile of dirty dishes. Imagine you have a pile of dirty dishes that you need to wash. As you wash each dish, you stack it on top of the pile. The last dish you wash and put on the top is the first one you'll grab when you need to use a clean dish.

- **LIFO Structure**: Just like the stack of plates, the dishes pile follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) structure. The dish you wash last and place on top becomes the first one you'll use.
- **Adding Dishes**: When you wash a dish, you add it on top of the pile, regardless of the type or size of the dish.
- **Removing Dishes**: When you need a clean dish, you take it from the top of the pile because it's the easiest and quickest to access.
- **Checking the Top**: You can quickly see which dish is on top of the pile without disturbing the rest of the stack.
- **One Access Point**: You only interact with the top dish. You can either add a new dish or take the top one, but you can't access dishes in the middle or at the bottom of the pile.
- **Preserving Order**: The order in which you wash and stack the dishes is maintained, reflecting the sequence of your washing actions.

In computer science, a stack is similar to this pile of dishes. It's a way to organize and manage data where the last item added is the first one to be removed. By visualizing a stack of plates or a pile of dirty dishes, you can grasp the concept of a stack and understand how it works in various computer algorithms and programs.
